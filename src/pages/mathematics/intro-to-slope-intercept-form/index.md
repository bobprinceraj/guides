## Intro to Slope Intercept Form

The slope-intercept form of a line is a very common way of expressing straight lines in a two dimensions. Often represented by the equation __y=mx+b__, it is easy to understand. You can find any point on a line by putting a value for x into the equation and simplifying to find the y-value.
Every straight line has a slope, a number representing its steepness. You can calculate the slope of a line by taking two points on the line, and divide the difference between the y-values by the difference between the x-values.
The slope of the line is the __m__ in the equation above. If you increase the x-value by 1, the y-value will increase by the value of the slope.
If that was all you needed for the equation, what would the y-value be when x is 0? It would always be 0. Every line would pass through the origin, (0,0). But in reality, not every line does so. That's what the __b__ value is for. It represents the y-value when x is 0, which is the same as the y-value at the y-intercept. Once you have the slope, you can plug a point into __y=mx+b__, and solve for b.
So to find the slope-intercept form of a line, you only need 2 points on the line, and you can calculate the slope, and then the y-intercept.
